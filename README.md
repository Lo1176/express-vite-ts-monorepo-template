# Monorepo template with Express React (Vite) and Typescript

Ready to go.
This is a monorepo template

- `Express`
- `Vite`
- `Typescript`

##### To start:

From <b>main repo</b>, <b>backend</b> folder and <b>frontend</b> folder: `pnpm i`

Then go back to the <b>main repo</b> and run `pnpm start`.
Thanks to [`concurrently`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently), it will execute both `pnpm dev`from backend and `pnpm start` from frontend folders.
