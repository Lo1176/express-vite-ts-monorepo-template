# Template for `Express` `React` (`Vite`) and `Typescript`

Ready to go.
This is a monorepo template

- `Express`
- `Vite`
- `Typescript`

To start:
From main repo, backend folder and frontend folder: `pnpm i`

Then go back to the main repo and run `pnpm start`.
Thanks to `currently`, it will execute both `pnpm dev`from backend and `pnpm start` from frontend folders.
